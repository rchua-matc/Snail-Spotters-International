            <h2>Habitat and Habits</h2>
            <p>The Iowa Pleistocene snail is found only in algific talus slopes: a fragile, rare habitat found almost exclusively in the Driftless Area of the Midwestern United States. Algific talus slopes are formed of cracked bedrock with separated pieces littering the area. In the summer, the slopes interact with nearby sinkholes and ice caves causing air circulation to reduce temperatures. These slopes maintain a temperature of about 30 - 55&deg; F from spring until fall.</p>
            <p>Due to its adaptation to existing during an Ice Age, the Iowa Pleistocene snail can only survive in temperatures around 35 - 45&deg; F. Confined to the cool, rocky slopes, these snails feed on leaf litter during warmer months. Breeding season occurs between March and August, with each litter containing only two to six eggs. In the winter, they burrow underground and become dormant. The average life span is 5 to 7 years.</p>
            <p>Several factors are contributing to the species' decline. Climate change is heavily affecting the Iowa Pleistocene snail due to the narrow window of temperatures it can survive in. Increasing global temperatures as well as logging, quarrying, agriculture, and construction have led to the loss of 75% of the snail's habitat since the 1850's.</p>

            <p>Algific talus slopes where the Iowa Pleistocene snail can be found are located in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Chapters of Snail Spotters International work closely with local wildlife agencies to better understand the population and distribution of these endangered snails. The most recent government study put the population in the United States at around 40,000 individuals. Members of the Austin, Texas chapter are working to map colonies in Iowa, while the Des Moines group is campaigning the Tallahassee, Florida city council to expand local search efforts.</p>
            <p>So far, none of our groups have reported sightings of <span class="italics">Discus macclintocki</span> in countries outside of the United States. A group of Snail Spotters from Singapore had one sighting while on a hiking expedition in Spain, but it was later found to be the related <span class="italics">Discus scutula.</span></p>

            <h2>Importance</h2>
            <p>The Iowa Pleistocene snail was believed to be extinct until 1955 when it was re-discovered in northeastern Iowa. However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the snail as a species of least concern. At Snail Spotters International, we believe that no species should be forgotten, and this is the snail-covered hill we've chosen to die on.</p>
            <p>Conservation efforts to protect the Iowa Pleistocene snail also benefit other endangered species. The rare northern blue monkshood flower is found on the same algific talus slopes and is a beautiful wildflower. Other glacial relict snails, like the Midwest Pleistocene vertigo, inhabit the same areas, but we just care about the vastly superior Iowa Pleistocene snail.</p>

            <h2>Snail Spotters International</h2>
            <p>Snail Spotters International hosts outreach programs to educate the public about conservation efforts. Currently, public awareness is the most effective way of convincing private landowners that have algific talus slopes to leave them undisturbed. We also conduct population studies to make up for the lack of attention on the part of other environmental groups and fund ecological research at public universities.</p>
